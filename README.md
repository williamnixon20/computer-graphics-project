## üñ•Ô∏è Key Features

### Models
- **Hollow Models:** Single-mesh objects, geometrically defined.
- **Articulated Models:** Multi-mesh objects with hierarchical rigging.
- **Transformations:** Translation, Rotation, and Scaling (TRS) supported for all models.
- **Save/Load Models:** Save model states (colors, textures, transformations) as JSON, and reload them as needed.

### Material & Shading
- **Basic Shading:** Displays ambient light with customizable colors.
- **Phong Shading:** Supports directional light, diffuse/specular mapping, shininess control, and texture mapping.
- **Texture Mapping:**
  - Diffuse, Specular, Displacement, and Normal maps supported.
  - Built-in textures for customization.

### Animation
- Frame-based animations with:
  - **Reverse Mode:** Play animations backward.
  - **Auto-Replay:** Loop animations continuously.
  - **Tweening:** Smooth transitions between frames using easing functions (Linear, Sine, Quad, etc.).
- Frame controls:
  - Play/Pause
  - Step Forward/Backward
  - Jump to First/Last Frame

### Camera
- **Orbit Control:** Mouse and scroll wheel for view manipulation.
- **Projection Modes:** Perspective, Orthographic, and Oblique.
- **Keyboard Controls:** Use WASD for movement.

### Advanced Features
- **Dual Canvas:** Visualize models from two independent camera perspectives.
- **GPU Picking:** Select objects on the canvas using GPU-based ID mapping.
- **Grayscale Postprocessing:** Render scenes with a grayscale effect.

## ‚ú® How to Use

### Basic Workflow
1. Load a model (hollow or articulated) from the GUI dropdown.
2. Apply transformations (TRS) and customize materials/shading.
3. Save your model to JSON for reuse.

### Animations
- Enable animations for articulated models using the animation tab.
- Adjust FPS and easing functions for smoother transitions.

### Camera Controls
- Adjust FOV and projection type from the camera tab.
- Use the mouse and keyboard for finer control.
